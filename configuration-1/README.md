# Configuration

The Edge Delta agents utilize a configuration file to manage various settings, such as: Inputs \(Sources\), Rules \(Monitors and Analytics\) that it performs against the data, as well as Destinations \(Streaming and Triggers\).

The configuration file is automatically loaded into memory at runtime. Updates to the configuration file are typically made via the CCB \(Central Configuration Backend\), or locally against the file itself. 

If configuration updates are made in the UI, via the CCB, these updates are automatically propagated down to the agent, without requiring a restart. 

## Schema

The configuration file has three main parts:

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Agent settings](https://docs.edgedelta.com/configuration/agent-settings) | Configure settings for Edge Delta agent, these settings apply to the whole configuration file |
| Inputs | Configure Inputs, what type of data sources you monitor \(files, syslog ports, docker containers, etc.\), and the location or configuration settings of these inputs.  |
| Outputs | Configure Outputs, these are either Streaming destinations, or Trigger destinations. Streaming destinations are typically Centralized Monitoring Platforms \(i.e. Splunk, Sumo Logic, Datadog, Snowflake, New Relic, Elastic, etc.\) that Edge Delta can be configured to send the analytics and insights continuously generated by the service. Trigger destinations are alerting and automation systems \(i.e. PagerDuty, Slack, ServiceNow, OpsGenie, Runbook, etc.\) that Edge Delta can be configured to send alerts and notifications to when anomalies or various conditions are met.  |
| Processors | Configure processors, these are user-defined patterns, analytics, and processing tools to analyze the incoming data streams. Processors can be defined using regular expressions, keyword matching, ratio analytics, tracing logic, as well as clustering and statistical analysis. |
| [Workflows](https://docs.edgedelta.com/configuration/workflows) | Configure Workflows, these are the mapping of Inputs, Outputs and Processors, typically grouped together \(as a Workflow\), depending on the different use-cases and analytics being performed.  |
| [Monitors](https://docs.edgedelta.com/configuration/monitors) | Configure rules, regexes and triggers |
