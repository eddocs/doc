# Central Configuration Backend \(CCB\)

The Edge Delta Central Configuration Backend \(CCB\) is a service provided by Edge Delta to help with the process of generating and deploying configuration files utilized by the Edge Delta service. 

With CCB, users can use the Edge Delta UI to create and manage configuration files, as well as automatically generate configuration API Keys used to pre-configure agents upon deployment.   

Additionally, CCB allows users to update and modify configuration files directly through the UI, automatically propagating changes down to running agents.

If you have many Edge Delta agents and agents have internet connectivity, use CCB to simplify distributing changes to all agents. 

With CCB, agents will download their configuration file from the Edge Delta cloud service at runtime. 

An installation file with a unique identifier \(API\_TOKEN\) is required for this configuration. Contact Edge Delta team [info@edgedelta.com](mailto:info@edgedelta.com) to get a download link.
