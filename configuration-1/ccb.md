# Central Configuration Backend \(CCB\)

If you have many Edge Delta agents and agents have internet connectivity, use CCB to simplify distributing changes to all agents. 

With CCB, agents will download their configuration file from the Edge Delta cloud service at runtime. 

An installation file with a unique identifier \(API\_TOKEN\) is required for this configuration. Contact Edge Delta team [info@edgedelta.com](mailto:info@edgedelta.com) to get a download link.
