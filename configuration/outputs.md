  This document outlines the various Output types (Streaming and Triggers)
  supported by the Edge Delta agent, and how the outputs are configured.

# Outputs

## Overview

Outputs are the mechanism that tells the Edge Delta agent which destinations to stream data, alerts, notifications, and automation. Outputs come in two forms, **Streaming** destinations, and **Trigger** destinations. 

\*\*\*\*[**Streaming destinations**](outputs.md#streaming-destinations) are typically Centralized Monitoring Platforms \(i.e. Splunk, Sumo Logic, Datadog, Snowflake, New Relic, Elastic, etc.\) that Edge Delta can be configured to send the analytics and insights continuously generated by the service.

\*\*\*\*[**Trigger destinations**](outputs.md#trigger-destinations) are alerting and automation systems \(i.e. PagerDuty, Slack, ServiceNow, OpsGenie, Runbook, etc.\) that Edge Delta can be configured to send alerts and notifications when anomalies are detected or various conditions are met.
